The WebUML system is a browser based UML editor that was originally developed for research purposes but can be used by anyone. The website offers features such as creating UML diagrams that consists of Classes, Packages, Attributes and Operations, the user of the system can also draw connections between the Class elements. There is also the possibility to save your diagram to an XMI file and then importing it as well. The programming languages used to develop the system was HTML/CSS and jQuery for most of its func- tionality. The goal of the project was to migrate the project from jQuery to Angular. This means that all the jQuery libraries and components where to be replaced with Angular components and Angular compatible libraries.
